# 🔗 URL Shorter

A small and simple URL shortener built with **Python + Flask**.
It takes those long, messy links and turns them into short, clean ones that are way easier to share with friends, in messages, or anywhere online.

Right now, it runs **locally on your machine** – but I’m planning to add support for multiple devices and hosting in the future.
